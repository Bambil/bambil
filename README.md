# Bambil 

Bambil is the first IoT application center ever. Bambil provides not only
services for those who are going to develop IoT based solutions but also Bambil
is trying to provide a set of standards for different emerging IoT platforms 
so that they will provide a set of APIs that are compatible with Bambil so
they can provide their applications on Bambil platform.

## Bambil Bambil :+1:

Bambil aims at reducing the specialization that is required to create IoT 
applications. Currently IoT applications require lots of specializtion from
hardware engineers to software engineers to DevOps. Our aim is to make the
only concern of hardware engineers who are designing IoT products be making
accurate sensors and good actuators not how they should connect it to the 
internet or etc. We'll take the responsibility of cloud and the task of
creating an IoT application becomes as simple as developing an android 
application!

We'll serve your IoT applications you don't have to even worry about scaling
runtime and etc. Another purpose of this platform is to maximize the use
of IoT infrastructure and help independent application developers develop 
applications for current IoT infrastructure of a house or building or 
an orginization.

Another thing we're thinking of is to get community to develop IoT 
applications. So they can get their applications to the market as easy as 
an android developer gets it to the market.

## Stay tuned
